Which one of the following describes a formal design process often used in the lifecycle of a network?,a. FRA |b. IEEE|c. PPDIOO|d. PBR,c. PPDIOO,"C. PPDIOO describes a lifecycle process consisting of six phases: Prepare, Plan, Design, Implement, Operate, and Optimize."
"When you meet with a customer to gather information about an upcoming wireless project, which one of the following things will be most helpful as you prepare to perform a site survey?",a. The scope of the project|b. A list of buildings and locations that need wireless service|c. Floor plans of buildings that need wireless service|d. Diagrams of the wired network infrastructure.,c. Floor plans of buildings that need wireless service,"C. Floor plans will be most helpful, as you will import those directly into the site survey or wireless planning tool. Then you will be able to locate APs accurately."
Suppose you collect information about the wireless devices that will be used at a customer’s site. Which one of the following specifications will determine which bands you should enable in your wireless design?,a. 802.11b/g/n|b. Data rates: 6–54Mbps|c. Antenna gain: 2.0 dBi|d. Sensitivity: 90 dB,a. 802.11b/g/n,"A. The specification of 802.11b/g/n reveals that the device will operate only on the 2.4GHz band. The 5GHz band would be supported with the inclusion of “a,” “ac,” or “ax.” The data rates, antenna gain, and receiver sensitivity are all important specifications, too, but they are not given as shown for a specific band."
Which one of the following wireless client specifications is helpful in designing the size of an AP cell?,a. The antenna gain|b. The receiver sensitivity|c. The number of spatial streams|d. The data rates supported,b. The receiver sensitivity,B. The receiver sensitivity is the most helpful because it defines the minimum usable signal strength a client can receive from an AP. The AP cell size is determined by the distance a client can be located from the AP before the AP’s signal falls below the receiver sensitivity
A high-density area in a wireless design is determined by which one of the following things?,a. More clients are using the 5GHz band than the 2.4GHz band.|b. A small number of clients in an area are using high-bandwidth applications.|c. A higher number of clients associate with each AP in an area.|d. A higher amount of RF coverage is needed in an area.,c. A higher number of clients associate with each AP in an area.,"C. High density in a wireless design is determined by the number of clients per AP in an area. If the user population is high in a small area, all of the users might end up joining a single AP. The goal of a good wireless design would be to add additional APs and distribute the clients across them, maintaining an adequate level of performance for each AP"
Which one of the following applications would be the most appropriate use for an AP model that has internal antennas?,a. A location where a relatively wide coverage area is desired|b. A location where coverage is needed toward one side of the AP|c. A location where a patch antenna’s pattern is required|d. A location where an omnidirectional antenna is not desirable,a. A location where a relatively wide coverage area is desired,"A. APs with internal or integrated antennas usually use omnidirectional antennas. Therefore, those APs are most useful in locations that need a broad coverage pattern. Otherwise, an AP with external antenna connectors would be more appropriate."
Suppose a customer wants potential users to enter a username and password before being granted access to the wireless network. Which of the following items could you add to the list of requirements for your wireless design to meet the customer’s requirement?,a. RADIUS servers|b. AAA servers|c. ISE servers|d. AES servers,a. RADIUS servers|b. AAA servers|c. ISE servers,"A, B, C. The customer is wanting user authentication, so you could leverage RADIUS, AAA, or ISE servers to meet that need. AES cannot be used to authenticate users because it is an encryption standard"
