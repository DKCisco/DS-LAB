Which one of the following describes a formal design process often used in the lifecycle of a network?	a. FRA |b. IEEE|c. PPDIOO|d. PBR	c. PPDIOO	C. PPDIOO describes a lifecycle process consisting of six phases: Prepare, Plan, Design, Implement, Operate, and Optimize.
When you meet with a customer to gather information about an upcoming wireless project, which one of the following things will be most helpful as you prepare to perform a site survey?	a. The scope of the project|b. A list of buildings and locations that need wireless service|c. Floor plans of buildings that need wireless service|d. Diagrams of the wired network infrastructure.	c. Floor plans of buildings that need wireless service	C. Floor plans will be most helpful, as you will import those directly into the site survey or wireless planning tool. Then you will be able to locate APs accurately.
Suppose you collect information about the wireless devices that will be used at a customer’s site. Which one of the following specifications will determine which bands you should enable in your wireless design?	a. 802.11b/g/n|b. Data rates: 6–54Mbps|c. Antenna gain: 2.0 dBi|d. Sensitivity: ?90 dB	a. 802.11b/g/n	A. The specification of 802.11b/g/n reveals that the device will operate only on the 2.4GHz band. The 5GHz band would be supported with the inclusion of “a,” “ac,” or “ax.” The data rates, antenna gain, and receiver sensitivity are all important specifications, too, but they are not given as shown for a specific band.
